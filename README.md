# FSI Reasoning Use Case Examples

This repository contains a collection of use case examples demonstrating reasoning capabilities with large language models (LLMs) like O1. Each use case is designed to evaluate interpretable reasoning, dataset referencing, and audit-friendly outputs in financial and insurance domains.

## Use Cases

### ðŸ“˜ Auto Insurance Risk Evaluation
Evaluates an auto insurance application using datasets like telematics, driving history, and vehicle maintenance logs. Emphasizes traceable, compliance-ready risk classification and justifies premium adjustments.

### ðŸ“˜ Cross-Asset Volatility and Sentiment Forecasting
Forecasts 30-day volatility across equities, bonds, and commodities using sentiment data, macroeconomic indicators, and option term structures. Ideal for showcasing O1â€™s dataset traceability and structured forecasting.

### ðŸ“˜ Insurance Claims Processing
Assesses a property claim for water damage and mold under specific coverage clauses. The use case highlights O1â€™s step-by-step analysis, regulatory interpretation, and payout calculation logic.

### ðŸ“˜ Comprehensive Insurance Coverage Analysis
Recommends core and add-on coverages for a small business using datasets on risks, incidents, state laws, and benchmark premiums. Showcases O1's structured evaluation of commercial risk and compliance.

### ðŸ“˜ Loan Agreement Risk Assessment
Performs legal risk assessment on a scanned loan contract with degraded footnotes. Focuses on clause-level interpretation, compliance flags, and legal reasoning, emphasizing O1â€™s strength in ambiguous data environments.

### ðŸ“˜ Global Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization
Optimizes asset allocation across a diversified global portfolio while meeting regulatory risk limits. Highlights O1â€™s ability to handle high-dimensional financial datasets and justify recommendations using correlations and constraints.

### ðŸ“˜ Commercial Insurance Underwriting
Conducts risk-adjusted premium analysis using historical claims, inspection reports, and compliance data. Illustrates O1â€™s strength in synthesizing multi-source data for commercial insurance underwriting.

Each use case is designed to challenge the modelâ€™s ability to interpret diverse, domain-specific datasets while producing explainable and regulator-friendly outputs.



# Executing the notebook to compare model outputs

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reasoning-llms-fsi-lab.git
    cd reasoning-llms-fsi-lab
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Copy the `env_sample` file to `.env` and add your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:
    ```sh
    cp env_sample .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to add your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:
    ```plaintext
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and observe the results.
