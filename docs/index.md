# Reasoning Models Workshop

This workshop provides an interactive exploration of Reasoning Models using Jupyter notebooks and real-world use cases. Learn how to leverage reasoning model's capabilities for complex analytical tasks and decision-making scenarios.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized into two main sections:

### Getting Started

1. **Setup & Environment** - Learn how to set up your Azure OpenAI environment and configure the necessary credentials.
2. **Basic Text Reasoning** - Explore fundamental concepts of reasoning models using simple text-based examples.
3. **Advanced Features** - Dive into advanced capabilities including:
   - Developer Messages
   - Structured Outputs
   - Function Calling
   - Vision Support
4. **Model Comparison** - Compare outputs between GPT and Reasoning models across different tasks.

### Use Cases

Explore practical applications of reasoning models across various domains:

- Credit Risk Assessment and Management
- Customer Relationship Management
- Data Analysis and Insights
- Fraud Detection and Prevention
- Insurance Claims Processing
- Insurance Plan Analysis
- Loan Agreement Analysis
- Market Sentiment Analysis
- Portfolio Optimization
- Risk Assessment for Underwriting
- Underwriting Analysis

## Key Features Covered

The notebooks demonstrate key capabilities of reasoning models:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Developer Messages | Set reasoning goals, persona, and context |
| Structured Outputs | Generate strictly formatted responses |
| Context Windows | Handle large input and output contexts |
| Reasoning Effort | Control the depth of analysis |
| Vision Support | Process and analyze images |
| Function Calling | Integrate with external tools and APIs |

## Prerequisites

1. Azure Account with OpenAI access
2. Python environment with required packages:
   - openai
   - azure-identity
   - python-dotenv
3. Basic understanding of:
   - Python programming
   - Jupyter notebooks
   - Machine learning concepts

The notebooks are self-contained with detailed explanations and examples to help you understand each concept thoroughly.

1. Walk away with a sandbox (and notebooks) that you can use, to experiment with application ideas, or to explore advanced reasoning concepts.
1. Star or watch the repo for updates. We'll continue to add new labs and scenarios to keep pace with the fast-growing set of models and capabilities for reasoning.
