# Model Comparison

This notebook provides a detailed comparison between GPT and Reasoning models across various tasks.

!!! info "Getting Started"
    To run these notebooks:
    1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/dhangerkapil/reasoning-llms-workshop)
    2. Follow setup instructions in the repository README
    3. Set up your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key

## Overview

Compare models on:
1. Response quality
2. Reasoning depth
3. Task suitability
4. Performance metrics

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Clarity
- Organization
- Structure
- Flow

### 2. Accuracy & Correctness
- Factual accuracy
- Calculation precision
- Logical soundness

### 3. Completeness
- Coverage of requirements
- Depth of analysis
- Thoroughness

### 4. Analytical Depth
- Reasoning quality
- Evidence usage
- Insight generation

### 5. Multi-Dataset Synthesis
- Data integration
- Cross-reference ability
- Pattern recognition

## Example Tasks

The notebook includes complex analytical tasks such as:
1. Market sentiment analysis
2. Risk assessment
3. Multi-modal data processing
4. Strategic recommendations

## Implementation

### Setup
```python
GPT_MODEL = 'gpt-4o-mini'
REASONING_MODEL = 'o4-mini'
```

### Comparison Process
1. Submit identical prompts
2. Collect responses
3. Analyze differences
4. Evaluate performance

## Key Findings

Typical differences in:
1. Response structure
2. Reasoning depth
3. Data integration
4. Recommendation quality

## Usage Guidelines

Choose:
- **GPT Models** for:
  - General text generation
  - Creative tasks
  - Simple Q&A

- **Reasoning Models** for:
  - Complex analysis
  - Multi-step reasoning
  - Structured outputs

## Best Practices

1. **Task Selection**
   - Match model to task
   - Consider complexity
   - Evaluate requirements

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Be specific
   - Provide context
   - Define expectations

3. **Output Analysis**
   - Use consistent criteria
   - Document differences
   - Track performance
