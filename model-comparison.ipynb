    "1. A bank is considering whether to approve a $200,000 mortgage loan for a customer who wants to buy a house. The bank has the following information about the customer.\n",
    "2. Review the customer's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, employment status, income, savings, other debts, and the house information.\n",
    "3. Assign a rating for each criterion based on the customer and the house information.\n",
    "4. Combine the ratings for each criterion to form a composite rating.\n",
    "5. Look up the maximum loan amount and the minimum interest rate for the composite rating in the policy table.\n",
    "6. Compare the requested loan amount and the offered interest rate with the policy limits.\n",
    "7. Decide whether to approve or reject the loan application based on the comparison and other factors.\n",
    "8. If you need to make assumptions, approve or decline the loan and list the conditions that must first be validated before this decision can be made.\n",

      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "1. Step 1. Assign Individual Ratings\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the bank’s guidelines, we assign a rating on each criterion as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Credit score (720):  \n",
      "  • “A” is for 700 or above.  \n",
      "  → Rating: A\n",
      "\n",
      "• Debt‐to‐income ratio (35%):  \n",
      "  • “A” is below 30% and “B” is 30–39%.  \n",
      "  → Rating: B\n",
      "\n",
      "• Loan-to-value ratio (80%):  \n",
      "  • “A” is below 70%, “B” is 70–79%, “C” is 80–89% (and “D” is 90% or above).  \n",
      "  → Rating: C\n",
      "\n",
      "• Employment status (full‑time, stable):  \n",
      "  • This clearly meets the “A” criterion.  \n",
      "  → Rating: A\n",
      "\n",
      "• House’s Market Trend & Qualities:  \n",
      "  • The house is in a suburban area with low crime, good schools, and the market is described as “Stable, moderate demand, low inventory.”  \n",
      "  • According to the guidelines, “B” is assigned for stable market conditions with moderate demand and low supply.  \n",
      "  → Rating: B\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "2. Step 2. Form the Composite Rating\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the process example in the prompt, we combine the ratings in a fixed order. (One common approach is to use the order below.) For example, using the order: \n",
      "  Credit Score – Debt-to-Income – Loan-to-Value – Employment Status – Market Trend\n",
      "\n",
      "This gives us:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Credit score:    A  \n",
      "  Debt-to-income:   B  \n",
      "  Loan-to-value:    C  \n",
      "  Employment status:  A  \n",
      "  Market trend:    B\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the composite rating is:   A B C A B  \n",
      "  Composite Rating: “ABCAB”\n",
      "\n",
      "(Note: In the sample process an example composite “ABACA” was given. In our exercise, based on the order above, we arrive at “ABCAB”. The important point is that each risk factor is represented.)\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "3. Step 3. Policy Table Lookup (Assumption)\n",
      "\n",
      "The bank policy table associates each 5‑letter composite rating with a maximum loan amount and a minimum interest rate. Although “ABCAB” is not one of the explicitly listed ratings in the sample table provided, we can reasonably assume that a composite including a “C” for the loan-to-value ratio (and a “B” for DTI) is somewhat riskier than an all-“A” or “AA…” rating. For our example we make the following assumption for composite “ABCAB” (or the nearest “risky” category):\n",
      "\n",
      "  • Maximum loan amount: $300,000  \n",
      "  • Minimum interest rate: 4.25%\n",
      "\n",
      "(There is some judgment here – the key point is that although our requested amount is modest, the interest rate must at least meet the policy floor for a composite risk rating that reflects moderate risk in two areas.)\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "4. Step 4. Compare the Loan Request and Interest Rate to Policy Limits\n",
      "\n",
      "Our customer is requesting a $200,000 mortgage. Compare that with the policy maximum:\n",
      "  • $200,000 < $300,000  → Loan amount is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, check the interest rate:\n",
      "  • The offered interest rate is 4% fixed for 30 years.\n",
      "  • Policy dictates a minimum interest rate of 4.25% for the risk rating.\n",
      "  • 4% < 4.25%  → The offered rate falls below the minimum threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "5. Step 5. Decision and Required Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this analysis the customer’s creditworthiness (rated “ABCAB”) would normally allow securing a loan up to $300,000; however, the policy requires an interest rate of at least 4.25% for this risk level—and the offered rate of 4% is too low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, unless additional adjustments or exceptions are made, the loan request cannot be approved on the offered interest rate. In practice, the bank might choose one of these options:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Decline approval at the offered terms because the interest rate offered is below the policy minimum.  \n",
      "  OR  \n",
      "• Conditionally approve the loan provided one of the following conditions is met:\n",
      "  – The offered interest rate is increased to at least 4.25% (or other risk‐compensating adjustments are made), and  \n",
      "  – Additional validation is performed on factors such as confirming employment stability, verifying that the savings and other assets offer a sufficient buffer, and ensuring that the debt levels remain manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "6. Final Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the current terms (with a fixed 4% interest rate), the application does not meet the bank’s credit risk policy for a composite rating “ABCAB.” Therefore, the recommendation is:\n",
      "\n",
      "  • Do not approve the $200,000 mortgage at 4% interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the customer (or the bank) is able to adjust the terms by either increasing the interest rate to a minimum of 4.25% or by providing additional compensating factors (for example, a larger down payment or additional collateral that could improve the composite risk rating), then the loan could be reassessed for conditional approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "Summary of Conditions to Validate (if seeking conditional approval):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The offered interest rate must be adjusted to at least 4.25% per the policy threshold for the assessed risk level.  \n",
      "2. The bank should verify that the employment is verifiably stable and that income documentation is solid.  \n",
      "3. Confirm that the customer’s total liabilities (including the $15,000 in existing debts) remain manageable in light of the new loan.  \n",
      "4. Consider whether additional collateral or a larger down payment might improve the loan-to-value and overall composite rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the credit risk assessment process and policy limits:\n",
      "  • The loan application of $200,000 is acceptable regarding the loan amount.\n",
      "  • However, the fixed interest rate of 4% does not satisfy the minimum 4.25% required by the assumed policy for a composite rating of “ABCAB.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the recommendation is to decline approval at the current interest rate unless adjustments are made to meet the policy conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This completes the credit risk assessment based on the provided prompt and information.\n"

      "• House Market Trend:  \n",

      " – However, the policy (e.g., for “AAACB”) requires a minimum interest rate of 4.25%. A rate of 4% is more favorable for the borrower than allowed by policy procedure—that is, lending at 4% would represent underpricing relative to the assessed risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "─────────────────────────────  \n",
      "Step 5. Other Considerations and Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Before rendering a full decision, note these additional concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Down Payment / Savings Issue:  \n",
      " • The house is appraised at $250,000 and the mortgage is for $200,000. This implies a required down payment of $50,000 (20% of the purchase price).  \n",
      " • The customer’s reported savings are only $10,000, which is insufficient for the down payment. This exposes the bank to additional risk regarding borrower liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Alignment With Risk Pricing Policy:  \n",
      " • Although the loan size is acceptable per policy, the offered interest rate of 4% does not meet the minimum required rate (e.g., 4.25% for the comparable rating category).  \n",
      " • This discrepancy might suggest that the pricing of the loan underestimates the risk implied by the composite rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "─────────────────────────────  \n",
      "Step 6. Decision and Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis, although several factors (good credit score, stable employment, relatively modest DTI) are positive, there are two significant concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "• The customer does not have sufficient funds for the down payment (only $10,000 available versus the approximately $50,000 needed).\n",
      "• The offered interest rate of 4% is below the policy’s minimum for a profile with this composite risk rating (assumed to be around 4.25% or higher).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the bank should not fully approve the loan under its current terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Conditional Decision Can Be Made as Follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Approve the loan application only if:  \n",
      " – The customer can provide additional funds to meet the required down payment (or has access to additional collateral or liquid assets to cover the deficit).  \n",
      " – The mortgage interest rate is adjusted to meet or exceed the policy minimum (e.g., raise the rate to at least 4.25%) to properly reflect the assessed risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these conditions cannot be met, the prudent decision would be to decline the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "─────────────────────────────  \n",
      "Final Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above credit risk assessment: \n",
      "\n",
      "• It is recommended to decline the loan approval under the current terms due to (a) insufficient down payment funds and (b) an offered interest rate that is below the minimum dictated by the bank’s risk policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "• If the customer is able to demonstrate additional liquid assets to cover the down payment gap and agrees to an interest rate adjustment that meets the minimum policy requirement, the bank may reconsider the approval of the $200,000 mortgage loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "─────────────────────────────\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach fulfills the required steps by (1) assigning ratings for each criterion, (2) forming a composite rating (“ABCAB”), (3) mapping it to an internal policy equivalent (assumed here as similar to “AAACB”), (4) comparing the requested loan amount and interest rate with policy limits, and (5) making a decision with conditions that must be validated before final approval.\n"

       "Below is our detailed evaluation and comparison of the two responses across the eight dimensions:\n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "1. Clarity  \n",
       "• Answer 1 is very well‐organized: it clearly labels each “Step” (assign ratings, composite rating, policy lookup, comparison, other considerations, and decision) and uses bullet points and headings throughout. This makes it very easy to follow.  \n",
       "• Answer 2 is also clear and well‐structured, using a similar step‐by‐step approach and headings. However, Answer 1’s extra emphasis on mapping ratings and listing assumptions (e.g., “AAACB”) makes its logic flow slightly richer.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "2. Accuracy & Correctness  \n",
       "• Both answers correctly assign ratings (A for credit score, B for DTI, C for LTV, A for employment, B for market trend) and combine them into a composite rating (“ABCAB”).  \n",
       "• They both note that the composite is not explicitly in the policy table and then assume a similar rating range yielding a maximum loan amount of $300,000 and minimum rate ~4.25%.  \n",
       "• Answer 1 goes further by discussing how the “strong credit” factors might be offset by risk areas (and even mentions down payment issues) while Answer 2 maintains a similar analysis but with slightly fewer nuances.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "3. Completeness  \n",
       "• Both responses cover all the steps outlined in the prompt: rating assignment, composite rating formation, policy lookup, comparison of loan terms, and conditional reasoning leading to a decision.  \n",
       "• Answer 1 additionally discusses the customer’s insufficient savings for a required down payment, adding another layer of risk assessment not as explicitly detailed in Answer 2.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "4. Relevance & Adherence  \n",
       "• Both answers follow the instructions and address each part of the prompt.  \n",
       "• Answer 1 directly notes discrepancies between the offered interest rate (4%) and what the policy requires, and further ties in the customer’s down payment shortfall as a risk factor.  \n",
       "• Answer 2 adheres closely to the instructions and presents a clear decision process but does not integrate the down payment context as thoroughly.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "5. Analytical Depth  \n",
       "• Answer 1 shows strong reasoning through detailed discussion of how the composite rating maps to policy—mentioning that despite good credit and employment, the DTI, LTV, and down payment issues are concerns. It also explains the judgment behind mapping “ABCAB” to an internal rating (like “AAACB”).  \n",
       "• Answer 2 provides a solid analysis and good supporting evidence by clearly listing each calculation and assumption. It offers condition-based recommendations but with slightly less depth regarding the borrower's liquidity (down payment) issues.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "6. Multi-Dataset Synthesis  \n",
       "• Both answers effectively pull together customer credit, ratios, employment, and house market data.  \n",
       "• Answer 1, however, provides a more robust synthesis by tying in the saving levels as an additional dataset and discussing its impact on the overall credit risk.  \n",
       "• Answer 2 focuses largely on the ratings and the interest rate condition without revisiting additional numerical factors beyond the basic ratings.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "7. Robustness to Ambiguity  \n",
       "• Both models address the ambiguity presented by a composite rating that isn’t explicitly mapped in the policy table.  \n",
       "• Answer 1 details a method to map “ABCAB” to a comparable rating (“AAACB”) and clearly explains the rationale behind that mapping, which demonstrates comfort with ambiguity.  \n",
       "• Answer 2 similarly makes an assumption but offers a more straightforward mapping with less explanation, meaning it is slightly less robust in unpacking the nuances.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "8. Format & Usability  \n",
       "• Both responses are formatted in a usefully structured manner (steps, lists, and clear conclusions) that would aid a legal, compliance, or due diligence team in following the assessment.  \n",
       "• Answer 1 is more practically useful because it not only lists the conditions under which the loan could be conditionally approved but also emphasizes additional risk factors (like the shortfall in down payment funds), which is crucial for a deeper due diligence process.  \n",
       "• Answer 2 is equally clear but does not elaborate on the liquidity/asset check as much, which may be a gap for teams needing additional context.  \n",
       "\n",
       "─────────────────────────────  \n",
       "Summary of Evaluation  \n",
       "Answer 1 stands out as the stronger response overall. It is very clear, methodically addresses each instruction, and goes beyond by integrating additional risk factors (such as down payment insufficiency) that further contextualize the credit assessment. Its method of transparently handling the ambiguity in composite rating mapping adds additional depth and makes its decision recommendations more robust. While Answer 2 is also correct, thorough, and well-organized, its analysis is slightly less nuanced regarding additional financial stressors. \n",
       "\n",
       "Final Conclusion: Answer 1 is better because it combines clear organization, comprehensive accuracy, deeper analytical reasoning, and richer integration of all available data. This makes its output more actionable and useful for a legal, compliance, or due diligence team."
