# Basic Text Reasoning

This notebook introduces fundamental concepts of working with reasoning models through text-based examples.

!!! info "Getting Started"
    To run these notebooks:
    1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/dhangerkapil/reasoning-llms-workshop)
    2. Follow setup instructions in the repository README
    3. Set up your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key

## Overview

Learn how to:
1. Use different reasoning levels (low, medium, high)
2. Structure prompts effectively
3. Analyze model responses
4. Compare performance across tasks

## Key Concepts

### Reasoning Levels
- Low: Quick, straightforward responses
- Medium: Balanced analysis and explanation
- High: Deep, thorough analysis with detailed rationale

### Model Interaction
- Setting up chat completions
- Using developer messages
- Handling responses
- Managing tokens

### Response Analysis
- Understanding reasoning tokens
- Evaluating response quality
- Measuring performance
- Analyzing token usage
