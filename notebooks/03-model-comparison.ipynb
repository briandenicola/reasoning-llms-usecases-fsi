      "After a thorough analysis of John Miller's auto insurance application, several key findings reveal a moderate risk profile. His driving history displays multiple infractions, and he has documented accident claims. However, recent improvements in his driving behavior, positive telematics data, and a strong credit score contribute to a more favorable overall assessment. Based on the evaluation, it is recommended that John Miller be offered comprehensive auto insurance coverage with standard premium rates but under a condition of monitored telematics for ongoing risk evaluation.\n",

      "- **Annual Mileage**: 12,000 miles (Average; typical driving mileage reflects a lower risk)\n",
      "- **Resident Area**: Urban (Higher risk exposure typically associated with urban driving)\n",

      "#### 2. **Driving Record History (Dataset 2)**\n",

      "  - **Total Infractions**: 3 (Notable infractions in 2017, 2019, and another in 2021)\n",

      "  - **Total Claim Amount**: $7,000 (Average claim severity is minor to moderate)\n",
      "  - The claims' severity hints at occasional higher risk, though none severe indicates a limited risk of catastrophic loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The frequency of accidents (3 in 4 years) leads to a risk conclusion that improvements in driving techniques are indeed necessary.\n",

      "Analysis of telematics data reveals that John Miller has recorded instances of aggressive driving patterns. Continuous monitoring via telematics is advisable as part of a condition for lower premiums.\n",
