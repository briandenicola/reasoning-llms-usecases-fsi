# Reasoning Models Workshop Overview

Reasoning models excel at complex problem-solving tasks and nuanced analysis that benefit from multi-step analysis or processingâ€”unlike simple question-answering. How do you know if a reasoning model is the right fit for _your_ scenario? In this workshop, we'll take you from core concepts to code-based exploration of reasoning models on Azure AI Foundry.

This repository contains a collection of use case examples demonstrating reasoning capabilities with large language models (LLMs) like the O series. Each use case is designed to evaluate interpretable reasoning, dataset referencing, and audit-friendly outputs in financial and insurance domains.

## Learning Objectives

This workshop is designed to jumpstart your journey into understanding and working with reasoning models in generative AI. By the end of the journey you should be able to:

1. **Understand Reasoning Models:** What they are, how they work, and how they differ from chat LLMs like GPT models.
2. **Deploy and Explore:** Learn to deploy and explore reasoning models using Azure AI Foundry.
3. **Integrate into Workflows:** Learn how to integrate reasoning models into your workflows using low-code and code-first approaches.
4. **Patterns and Practices:** Gain insights into patterns and practices for practical applications with examples across industries.
5. **Compare Outputs:** Compare outputs of reasoning models vs. GPT models to understand where each excels.

## Use Cases

### ðŸ“˜ [Auto Insurance Risk Evaluation](./usecases/risk-assessment-for-underwriting-health-auto-life-property/README.md)
Evaluates an auto insurance application using datasets like telematics, driving history, and vehicle maintenance logs. Emphasizes traceable, compliance-ready risk classification and justifies premium adjustments.

### ðŸ“˜ [Cross-Asset Volatility and Sentiment Forecasting](./usecases/market-sentiment-and-volatility-forecasting/README.md)
Forecasts 30-day volatility across equities, bonds, and commodities using sentiment data, macroeconomic indicators, and option term structures. Ideal for showcasing O1â€™s dataset traceability and structured forecasting.

### ðŸ“˜ [Insurance Claims Processing](./usecases/insurance-claims-processing/README.md)
Assesses a property claim for water damage and mold under specific coverage clauses. The use case highlights O1â€™s step-by-step analysis, regulatory interpretation, and payout calculation logic.

### ðŸ“˜ [Comprehensive Insurance Coverage Analysis](./usecases/insurance-plan/README.md)
Recommends core and add-on coverages for a small business using datasets on risks, incidents, state laws, and benchmark premiums. Showcases O1's structured evaluation of commercial risk and compliance.

### ðŸ“˜ [Loan Agreement Risk Assessment](./usecases/loan-agreement/README.md)
Performs legal risk assessment on a scanned loan contract with degraded footnotes. Focuses on clause-level interpretation, compliance flags, and legal reasoning, emphasizing O1â€™s strength in ambiguous data environments.

### ðŸ“˜ [Global Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization](./usecases/portfolio-optimization/README.md)
Optimizes asset allocation across a diversified global portfolio while meeting regulatory risk limits. Highlights O1â€™s ability to handle high-dimensional financial datasets and justify recommendations using correlations and constraints.

### ðŸ“˜ [Commercial Insurance Underwriting](./usecases/underwriting-analysis/README.md)
Conducts risk-adjusted premium analysis using historical claims, inspection reports, and compliance data. Illustrates O1â€™s strength in synthesizing multi-source data for commercial insurance underwriting.

### ðŸ“˜ [Personalized Banking Insights for Client Retention](./usecases/customer-relationship-management/README.md)
Analyzes behavior, transaction patterns, and customer feedback to recommend tailored banking services. Demonstrates O1â€™s ability to distill actionable client insights from structured and semi-structured financial datasets.

### ðŸ“˜ [Credit Risk Assessment and Management](./usecases/credit-risk-assessment-and-management/README.md)
Assesses borrower creditworthiness using repayment history, credit scores, and regulatory thresholds. Highlights O1â€™s strength in transparent scoring, compliance flagging, and precise lending classification.

### ðŸ“˜ [Fraud Detection and Compliance Triggers](./usecases/fraud-detection-and-prevention/README.md)
Uses behavioral anomalies, transaction metadata, and rule-based compliance filters to flag potential fraud cases. Designed to demonstrate O1â€™s interpretability in high-stakes forensic audits and compliance workflows.

# Executing the Notebook to Compare Model Outputs

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dhangerkapil/reasoning-llms-usecases-fsi.git
    cd reasoning-llms-usecases-fsi
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For Linux/macOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Copy the `env_sample` file to `.env` and add your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:**
    ```sh
    cp env_sample .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to add your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:
    ```plaintext
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

5. **Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and observe the results.**
